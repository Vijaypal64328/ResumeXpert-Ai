# Your Immediate Options for Google AI Quota Issues

## Current Situation
You've hit the **daily quota limit** (50 requests) for Google Generative AI free tier. This is **quota exhaustion**, not rate limiting, so retrying won't help.

## üöÄ Immediate Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Free Multi-Model Strategy (Recommended for Testing)
**Cost: $0/month**
**Capacity: 150 requests/day (50 per model √ó 3 models)**

```bash
# Set this in your .env file
AI_TIER=free
ENABLE_MULTI_MODEL=true
```

**What this gives you:**
- 3√ó daily capacity using different Gemini models
- Automatic fallback when one model hits quota
- Zero cost increase
- Perfect for development and testing

### Option 2: Basic Paid Plan
**Cost: $5-10/month**
**Capacity: 1000+ requests/day**

```bash
# Set this in your .env file
AI_TIER=basic
DAILY_AI_BUDGET=0.50
```

**What this gives you:**
- 20√ó more daily requests
- Higher quality with Gemini 1.5 Pro for complex tasks
- Cost tracking and budget alerts
- Production-ready capacity

## üìä Quick Comparison

| Feature | Free Multi-Model | Basic Paid |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| Daily Requests | 150 | 1000+ |
| Monthly Cost | $0 | $5-10 |
| Model Quality | Mixed | High |
| Best For | Development | Production |

### For Option 1 (Free Multi-Model):
1. I can immediately integrate the multi-model fallback system
