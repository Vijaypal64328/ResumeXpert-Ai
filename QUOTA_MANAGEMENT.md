# Google Generative AI Quota Management

## Current Issue
You've hit the **daily quota limit** for Google Generative AI Free Tier:
- **Limit**: 50 requests per day per model
- **Current Status**: Quota exceeded
- **Reset Time**: Daily (typically at midnight PST)

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Wait for Quota Reset
The quota resets daily. You can:
- Wait until tomorrow for the free quota to reset
- Check the current time and plan usage accordingly

### 2. Upgrade Your Plan
Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to:
- Upgrade to a paid plan for higher quotas
- Get access to higher rate limits
- Remove daily restrictions

### 3. Optimize Usage (Development)
For development and testing:

```javascript
// Add quota tracking to your requests
let dailyRequestCount = 0;
const DAILY_QUOTA_LIMIT = 45; // Leave some buffer

if (dailyRequestCount >= DAILY_QUOTA_LIMIT) {
    return res.status(429).json({
        message: 'Daily AI quota limit reached. Please try again tomorrow.'
    });
}
```

## Enhanced Error Handling Implemented

The system now distinguishes between:

1. **Quota Exhaustion** (Daily/Monthly limits reached)
   - No retries attempted
   - Clear message to user about quota limits
   - Suggests upgrading plan

2. **Rate Limiting** (Temporary overload)
   - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
   - Usually resolves within seconds

3. **Other Errors** (API keys, network issues)
   - No retries for non-recoverable errors
   - Appropriate error messages

## Quota Monitoring

### Current Status Check
```bash
# Check your current quota usage at:
# https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/quotas
```

### Implementation in Code
```javascript
// Optional: Add usage tracking
const trackAIUsage = async (userId, endpoint) => {
    await db.collection('aiUsage').add({
        userId,
        endpoint,
        timestamp: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
        date: new Date().toDateString()
    });
};
```

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Upgrade to Paid Plan** - Most reliable solution
2. **Cache AI Responses** - Reduce duplicate requests
3. **Batch Operations** - Combine multiple small requests

### Long Term
1. **Implement Request Queuing** - Handle high volume gracefully
2. **Add Fallback Responses** - Provide value even when AI is unavailable
3. **Usage Analytics** - Track patterns and optimize

## Plan Options

### Free Tier
- 50 requests/day
- Good for development and testing

### Paid Plans
- Higher quotas (1,000+ requests/day)
- Better rate limits
- Production-ready reliability

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Wait for quota reset or upgrade plan
2. **Short term**: Implement request caching
3. **Long term**: Add quota monitoring and usage optimization

## Testing After Quota Reset

```bash
# Test a simple AI request after quota resets
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/fix-field \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"field": "test", "value": "test text"}'
```

The enhanced error handling will now properly detect quota vs rate limit issues and provide appropriate user feedback.
